# TODO

- Make validation case insensitive
- Build regular expression that does most of the validation work
- Add menu loop to main function
- Remove memory allocation from Converter
- Combine data constants from Validator and combine them with ArabicToRoman
- Move logic from main.c to another file so arg parsing can be unit tested
